# Sales-Analysis-Dashboard
This project analyzes sales and cost data from retail stores across different regions for the years 2020–2022.

## Project Overview
This project analyzes sales and cost data from retail stores across different regions for the years 2020–2022. The goal was to evaluate sales performance, cost drivers, and store-level efficiency to support data-driven decision-making for management.

## Business Problem
Retail leadership requires a clear understanding of how sales and operating costs vary by store size, type, department, and location, as well as visibility into how individual stores perform against their targets.

## Tools
• Power BI for data modeling, analysis, and visualization

• Power Query to clean, transform, and standardize raw sales and cost data

• DAX to create core financial and performance measures.

## Data Cleaning
The raw sales and cost data from multiple stores and regions required preprocessing before analysis. Power Query was used to clean, standardize, and prepare the data for reliable reporting.
Key steps included:

• Removed duplicate and irrelevant records to ensure data accuracy

• Handled missing and null values in sales, cost, and store attributes

• Standardized column names, data types, and date formats across all tables

• Created a structured date column to support time-based analysis (Year, Month, YTD)

• Categorized stores by store size, store type, and location to enable segmented analysis

• Ensured consistency between sales and cost tables for accurate aggregation and modeling.

## Data Analysis
After cleaning, the data was modeled in Power BI to support multi-dimensional analysis across time, store attributes, and departments. DAX measures were created to calculate key performance indicators and financial metrics, including Total Sales, Total Cost, Gross Margin, Total Sales YTD, and Variance from Target.
